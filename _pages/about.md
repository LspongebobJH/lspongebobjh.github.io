I am currently a final-year MPhil student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). I was also fortunate to work with [Dr. Yang Lu](https://engineering.wisc.edu/directory/profile/yang-lu/). Prior to that, I was an intern in Amazon Shanghai AI Lab, working with [Dr. David Wipf](http://www.davidwipf.com/), [Dr. Xiang Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LyPpCKwAAAAJ&hl=en) and many great colleagues. Before joining the Amazon, I was an intern in GAMMA Lab, BUPT, under the supervision of [Prof. Chuan Shi](http://shichuan.org/).
