I am currently a final-year MPhil student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) under the supervision of [Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/). Prior to that, I was an intern in Amazon Shanghai AI Lab, working with [Dr. David Wipf](http://www.davidwipf.com/), [Dr. Xiang Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LyPpCKwAAAAJ&hl=en), and many great colleagues. I was working as a contributor of the [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/) framework and conducting research on Graph Neural Networks related topics. Before joining the Amazon, I was an intern in GAMMA Lab, BUPT, under the supervision of [Prof. Chuan Shi](http://shichuan.org/). I was working as a contributor of the [OpenHGNN](https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/OpenHGNN) framework.
